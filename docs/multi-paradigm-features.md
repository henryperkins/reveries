# Multi-Paradigm Research System Features

## Overview

The 4 Hosts Research Architecture has been enhanced with three advanced phases that transform it from a single-paradigm router to a sophisticated multi-paradigm consciousness system.

## Phase 7: Multi-Paradigm Blending üîÄ

When multiple paradigms have high probabilities (‚â•35%), the system can blend their perspectives:

### Blending Strategies

1. **Weighted Blending** (Default)
   - All qualifying paradigms execute independently
   - Results combined proportionally by probability
   - Sources deduplicated with cumulative scoring
   - Final synthesis shows each paradigm's contribution

2. **Sequential Blending** (Complementary Pairs)
   - Used for: Bernard‚ÜíDolores, Teddy‚ÜíMaeve
   - Each paradigm builds on previous insights
   - Creates evolving understanding
   - Shows progression of thought

3. **Collaborative Blending** (Conflicting Pairs)
   - Used for: Dolores vs Teddy, Maeve vs Teddy
   - Query decomposed into sub-problems
   - Each paradigm tackles their strength area
   - Results synthesized into unified response

### Example
Query: "How do I implement a theoretical framework in practice?"
- Bernard (45%): Analyzes theoretical foundations
- Dolores (40%): Provides implementation steps
- Result: Sequential blend where theory informs practice

## Phase 8: Paradigm Learning & Adaptation üß†

The system learns from every interaction to improve paradigm selection:

### Features
- **Query Feature Extraction**: Identifies action words, domains, query types
- **Performance Tracking**: Records success/failure with user satisfaction
- **Adaptive Probability Adjustment**: ¬±10% based on historical success
- **Domain-Specific Weights**: 0.5-1.5x multiplier per paradigm per domain
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies successful paradigm-query combinations
- **7-Day Rolling Window**: Focuses on recent performance trends

### Example
After several successful Bernard selections for "framework" queries in technology domain:
- Bernard gets +20% probability boost for similar queries
- System remembers: "Bernard excels at analytical questions in technology"

## Phase 9: Inter-Host Collaboration ü§ù

Hosts can collaborate when confidence is low or expertise is needed:

### Collaboration Rules
- **Dolores ‚Üí Bernard**: Needs analytical validation before major actions
- **Dolores ‚Üí Teddy**: Checks stakeholder protection during change
- **Teddy ‚Üí Maeve**: Seeks strategic input for complex situations
- **Teddy ‚Üí Dolores**: Needs decisive action for protection
- **Bernard ‚Üí Dolores**: Needs help implementing theories
- **Bernard ‚Üí Maeve**: Seeks strategic implications of analysis
- **Maeve ‚Üí Bernard**: Needs deep analysis for decisions
- **Maeve ‚Üí Teddy**: Checks stakeholder impact of strategies

### Collaboration Process
1. Primary host detects low confidence
2. Identifies which host can help
3. Formulates specific question
4. Collaborating host provides insights
5. Primary integrates collaborative wisdom
6. Both hosts store memory of collaboration

## UI Enhancements

### Multi-Paradigm Indicator
- Shows all active paradigms with percentages
- Displays probability bar visualization
- Indicates blending strategy in use

### Inter-Host Collaboration Cards
- Real-time collaboration notifications
- Shows: From Host ‚Üí To Host
- Displays collaboration reason
- Status: pending/processing/completed

### Enhanced Research Results
- Collaborative insights marked clearly
- Multi-paradigm contributions highlighted
- Confidence scores reflect blended wisdom

## Testing the System

Try these queries to see multi-paradigm features:

1. **Multi-Paradigm Trigger**: "How can I strategically implement changes while protecting everyone?"
   - Activates: Maeve (strategy) + Dolores (implementation) + Teddy (protection)

2. **Sequential Blending**: "Explain the theory behind neural networks and how to build one"
   - Activates: Bernard (theory) ‚Üí Dolores (implementation)

3. **Collaboration Trigger**: "How do I [low confidence topic]?"
   - Primary paradigm seeks help from complementary host

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Richer Responses**: Multiple perspectives create comprehensive answers
2. **Self-Improving**: Learns from every interaction
3. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Hosts help each other overcome weaknesses
4. **Adaptive**: Adjusts to user preferences and domain patterns
5. **Resilient**: Falls back gracefully when single paradigm insufficient

The system evolves from choosing one voice to orchestrating a symphony of specialized intelligences, each contributing their unique strengths to create responses that are simultaneously action-oriented, analytically rigorous, protectively comprehensive, and strategically optimized.
