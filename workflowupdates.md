	I've reviewed your CodeQL workflow configuration file. It's already set up well to analyze JavaScript and TypeScript code, which matches your repository's primary languages (76.8% TypeScript and 0.8% JavaScript). However, I can suggest some improvements to enhance security scanning and performance:

```yaml name=.github/workflows/codeql.yml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '36 23 * * 5'  # Runs at 23:36 UTC every Friday
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'javascript', 'typescript' ]
        # Learn more about CodeQL language support: https://aka.ms/codeql-docs/language-support

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        # Fetch depth 0 ensures all history is fetched, which can help with some analyses
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: '**/package-lock.json'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    # Initializes the CodeQL tools for scanning
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
        # For more advanced configurations, see: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning
        queries: security-and-quality
        # Enable scanning of dependencies for vulnerable components
        tools: latest
        
    # For compiled languages like TypeScript, the Autobuild step attempts to build the project
    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
      with:
        category: "/language:${{matrix.language}}"
        # Output detailed summary information about alerts
        output: sarif-results
        upload: true
        
    # Optional: Upload SARIF results separately if you need to process them
    - name: Upload SARIF results
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
      with:
        sarif_file: sarif-results
```

Key improvements made:

1. **Enhanced checkout** with `fetch-depth: 0` to provide better history for analysis
2. **Improved cache configuration** with `cache-dependency-path` pattern
3. **Advanced CodeQL configuration** with:
   - `queries: security-and-quality` to run extended security checks
   - `tools: latest` to ensure you're using the latest compatible tools
4. **Better results handling** with:
   - Detailed output configuration
   - Explicit upload of SARIF results

This configuration will provide more thorough security scanning while maintaining good performance with the improved caching strategy. The workflow still focuses on JavaScript and TypeScript, which aligns with your repository's composition.

# CodeQL and CI Workflow Optimization

Thank you for providing such a thorough breakdown of the issues. You're absolutely right on both counts - we need to address the Node.js version mismatch and the duplicate CodeQL language analysis.

## Updated CodeQL Workflow

Here's the optimized CodeQL workflow file that fixes both issues:

```yaml name=.github/workflows/codeql.yml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '36 23 * * 5'  # Runs at 23:36 UTC every Friday
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        # CodeQL automatically handles TypeScript when using 'javascript'
        language: [ 'javascript' ]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'  # Upgraded to satisfy package requirements
        cache: 'npm'

    # Quick check to ensure Node version requirements are met
    - name: Verify Node.js version
      run: |
        node -e "const v=process.versions.node.split('.')[0]; 
        if(v<20){console.error('Node â‰¥20 required'); process.exit(1)}"

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
        queries: security-and-quality

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
      with:
        category: "/language:${{matrix.language}}"
```

## Key Changes:

1. **Fixed Node.js Version**: 
   - Upgraded from Node 18 to Node 20 to satisfy package requirements for Vite 7 and @google/genai
   - Added a verification step that will fail fast if Node requirements aren't met

2. **Optimized CodeQL Matrix**:
   - Removed 'typescript' from the matrix since CodeQL automatically includes TypeScript files when using 'javascript'
   - Added a comment explaining this behavior to prevent future confusion

3. **Added Quality Queries**: 
   - Set `queries: security-and-quality` to get more comprehensive analysis

## Additional Recommendations:

1. **Update package.json with Engine Requirements**:
   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": ">=20.0.0"
   },
   "engineStrict": true
   ```

2. **Ensure Consistency**: If you have other CI workflows that use Node.js, make sure to update those to use Node 20 as well for consistency.

These changes will eliminate the `EBADENGINE` warnings and optimize your CodeQL analysis by preventing duplicate scans, resulting in faster and more efficient CI runs.
